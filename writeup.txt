#########Notes on analysis###################
--Probably limit ourselves mostly to single-predictor models since our usual means of accounting for collinearity/association between predictors are inappropriate for categorical predictors. QQ plots, etc for binary predictors don't make sense.

--Many response variables are discrete data (eg total number of incidents). We may need to look at Poisson regression

--A good deal of imputation has been done on the data.
---Avg percent daily attendance was left as-is although it is suspected that the question was misinterpretted to mean percent daily absences. This results in a lot of outliers and should probably be inputed before being used.

--The population of schools was stratified and the overall model was complicated. The documentation provides adjustments for variance of coefficients.

########Predictors and Response##############
-Avg percent daily attendance as a predictor:
--of total police reports (discrete)
--of total # gang/hate crimes (discrete)
--of other crimes (?)

Avg percent daily attendance as response:
--to loss of bus as form of punishment (binary)
--to loss of privileges as form of punishment (binary)
--to total # class disruptions (discrete)
--to serious violent incidents (discrete)
--to crime where students live (categorical)
---try backward elimination?
---look at effect sizes for binary variables?


Crisis Plans as Predictor:
--of violent incidences (discrete)
---effect size


#########Outliers, etc###################
-One school had 1240 violent incidences. Next highest is ~300. Avg was 19.
-Most schools' gang related incidents are at or below 60, but a small number are hovering in the 150s.
