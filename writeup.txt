#########Notes on analysis###################
--Probably limit ourselves mostly to single-predictor models since our usual means of accounting for collinearity/association between predictors are inappropriate for categorical predictors

--Many response variables are discrete data (eg total number of incidents). We may need to look at Poisson regression

--A good deal of imputation has been done on the data.
---Avg percent daily attendance was left as-is although it is suspected that the question was misinterpretted to mean percent daily absences. This results in a lot of outliers and should probably be inputed before being used.

--The population of schools was stratified and the overall model was complicated. The documentation provides adjustments for variance of coefficients.



















########Predictors and Response##############
-Avg percent daily attendance as a predictor:
--of total police reports
--of total # gang/hate crimes
--of other crimes

Avg percent daily attendance as response:
--to loss of bus as form of punishment
--to total # class disruptions
--to serious violent incidents
--to crime where students live
