* In the graph of Violent Incidents Reported vs Attendance Percentage Rate, I'm curious about why violent incidents are being treated as a factor. Is this in order to provide a density estimate at each level or is it because Violent Incidents is discrete?

X Did not address this. -Joe - Done -Mike
--------------------------------
* Also, when looking at the functional form of a relationship between Y and X, it's a good idea to consider an added variable plot in addition to a marginal plot. 

X We still need to include this. We found better linear models with the zero flags (not yet redone--should wait until after this step) and the outliers eliminated, but the linear model is still piss-poor. We could look at some non-linear ones. -Joe
--------------------------------
* I notice you found evidence of non-normality, but there doesn't seem to be any discussion of whether the non-normality is likely to be significant or not. Have you considered formal inferential methods? Also, non-normality and non-constant error variance often go together, but I don't see a discussion of the latter here. Finally, if you do find evidence of significant problems, you should consider a transformation of your response variable (e.g. via Box-Cox) to see if that helps.

(.5)O Included examination of heteroscedasticity, but have not looked into variable transformations. I did the KS-test for non-normality and found that it is significant. We probably need to address this, but that part of it, at least, can be explored by trying some higher-order linear models, etc etc.-Joe

- added some polynomial models. - Mike 
- Made model comparison's of categorical variable vs non categorical variables. - Mike

* You've done a good job with model selection so far, but I think you can code it more efficiently with the methods we just covered in class. This may also help organize your output to be clearer.

X/O A lot changed when I implemented the zero flags Melissa mentions farther down. We use the leaps package for model selection, which is efficient. We could consider omitting the alternative exploration, but if there's anything useful or interesting in there, leaving it in does give us stuff to talk about. Up to ya'll.
-------------------------------
* You are right to note that the R^2's for your models are so low as to render them useless for most practical tasks. This is a good conclusion based on the evidence. It either means that there is no association between the variables and we should look for a new set of predictors, or it means that the association is non-linear and our model isn't picking up on it. It is unclear which is the case for some variables. Again, try residual plots and added variable plots to help examine the evidence.

X I basically fixed the linear model as much as it can be fixed according to Melissa's advice, but I did not look at other models yet.
-------------------------------
* You have a great process in analyzing your data-- everything looks good. When you give the presentation, just make sure to explain what you are doing and why, though; your plots should always support your arguments (not the other way around).
